		Brief summary of the course
		</summary>
		<p>
			<i>In this course we are going to investigate one of the key concepts of computer science,
			namely that of (functional) programming language. In particular, we are going to stress
			its theoretical fundations and (a small amount of) its relations with (a small part of)
			mathematical logic. The main theme is the notion of computation, in its mathematical shape,
			and how it enlighten the understanding of logic. Historically speaking, we cover some
			aspects of theoretical computer science and mathematical logic developed around the '70
			(with, at the end of this course, a brief introduction to one – among infinitely many –
			modern research topic which conceptually follow it).</i>

Slides and/or notes for the lectures will appear here soon.</br>

<br>Each lecture will adress a couple of important points in the theory of programs and proofs, by giving some of its basic elements.</br>
